collection: publications
permalink: /publication/agri-iot
excerpt: 'A pressing concern in agriculture today is the absence of data-driven decision-making, which poses significant challenges for farmers, particularly those in less-developed regions. The dearth of real-time data and technological resources inhibits informed decision-making regarding essential aspects such as weather conditions, soil health, pest infestations, and crop development. This data deficiency leads to a host of issues, including inefficient resource
management, overuse of water, excessive pesticide and fertilizer
application, and, consequently, soil degradation, water pollution,
and decreased agricultural productivity.'
